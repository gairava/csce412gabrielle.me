            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Howdy, my name is Gabrielle Anne Irava. I am a Texas A&M University student and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science
                in Computer Science. I am passionate about exploring different topics and applications of computer science, which is why I am
                double minoring in Cyber Security and Game Design and Development. 
            </p>
            <p> I am currently taking and have already completed several courses that go over foundational topics of computer science. The list includes: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Foundations of Software Engineering</li>
                <li>Introduction to Computer Systems</li>
                <li>Computer Organization</li>
                <li>Discrete Structures for Computing</li>
                <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
                <li>Program Design and Concepts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Of course, in pursuing my minors I will also be taking courses that go over cyber security as well as game development. Out of all of the courses I will be taking to fulfill these minor requirements, I'm most interested in CSCE 436 — Computer - Human Interaction — which is a course for my game design and development minor. As you'll see later in my 
                <a class="text-link" href="qualifications.html">qualifications</a>
                page, my interest in game development started because of my own love for playing video games with friends! This led me to want to learn more about how a team of developers created games.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also interested in entrepreneurship. Since the tech industry is constantly improving and rapidly growing in size, many start up tech businesses are beginning to pop up and thrive in the market. Therefore, I was interested in learning more about entrepreneurship since there is a high likelihood that I'll end up working for one. To supplement this knowledge, I enrolled in the Engineering Entrepreneurship Program to specifically pursue the 
                <a class="text-link" href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/academics/certificates/c3-certificate.html" target="_blank">
                    concept, creation and commercialization (C3) certificate</a>.
                It wasn't until my first C3 course that I began to think about creating my own business! Listening to the stories of other aggie entrepreneurs have been inspiring and invaluable.
